I'm a dedicated Cybersecurity Engineer at FAIRLY MADE in Paris, where since September 2023, I've been privileged to contribute to the safety of our digital world. My journey in tech began with a curiosity that led me from web development to crafting iOS apps at Whoomies, and eventually, to the complex field of cybersecurity. Each step has been a learning opportunity, allowing me to deepen my understanding and apply my skills in meaningful ways. I'm grateful for the journey and eager to continue growing, learning, and contributing alongside others passionate about making our digital spaces secure. Let's connect and share insights!
