For a long time i called everything that touched changing something about an asset Patching, however it hit me hard when i knew that there other terms we can use.

See Patching is more about updating software to fix vulnerabilities, improve performance or adding new features. In the context of security, patches are crucial for mitigating risks and protecting systems from exploits or attacks. an example is a new patch is released for a server's operating system that fixes a critical remote code execution vulnerability.


Rehydeation however is a term we use when we want to replace outdated servers with new ones that are fully updated, ensuring optimal performance and security, it is an alternative to traditional patching, focusing on continual replacement of instances rather than in-place updates.
