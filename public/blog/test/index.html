    Security engineering
  </h1>

  <article class="main-content">
    <p>The title of cybersecurity engineer has always intrigued me because it holds different meanings depending on where you work. In one company, you might be configuring firewalls, while in another, you could be handling GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance). However, for Ross Anderson:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Security engineering is mainly about building systems that remain dependable in the face of malice, error, and mischance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, processes, and methods needed to design, implement, and test complete systems, as well as adapt existing systems as their environment evolves.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, our role as cybersecurity engineers is to ensure that the environment we work in can function in the face of malicious attacks and is resistant to them. This means it’s not only about security-focused solutions like firewalls, EDRs (e.g., detecting malware on endpoints), and SIEMs (e.g., monitoring and analyzing security data) but also involves every action, resource, or asset that exists in that environment. For example, implementing secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities, ensuring employees receive training to recognize phishing emails, and regularly updating software to patch known exploits—all contribute to a resilient system.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving, characterized by escalating threats such as ransomware attacks and data breaches. With the rise of artificial intelligence, these threats are emerging at an unprecedented pace. As a result, the demand for cybersecurity roles has never been more critical. Organizations, especially small and medium-sized businesses, need skilled professionals who can orchestrate and implement effective cybersecurity strategies. A single cybersecurity engineer can be instrumental in establishing a robust security posture, enabling these businesses to protect their assets and mitigate risks in this dynamic environment</p>
